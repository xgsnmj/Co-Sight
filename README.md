## 🚀 Still worried about the invitation code? One-click deployment of Co-Sight to quickly build your own Manus-like system!

[![简体中文](https://img.shields.io/badge/简体中文-点击查看-orange)](README-zh.md)

Since the release of Manus, some closed-source platforms have faced problems such as high cost, limited access, and difficulty in privatization deployment, although they have excellent user experience and commercial support. Although open source frameworks have higher flexibility and transparency, they are slightly lacking in terms of functional integrity, style richness, and stability.

**Co-Sight** Committed to striking the best balance between cost, quality, stability and ease of use. It supports low-cost large models to generate high-quality and beautiful reports comparable to Claude models, and can be flexibly deployed in private environments, helping enterprises and individuals quickly build their own Manus-like systems.
